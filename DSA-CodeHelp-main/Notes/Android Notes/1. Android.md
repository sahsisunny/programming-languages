## Why android?
- Because it is open source. and it is free.
- Easy to use.
- It is easy to develop applications for android.
- It is easy to customize.
- It is easy to port.
- It is easy to integrate with other applications.

## Android Runtime(ART)
- ART is a new runtime for Android that replaces Dalvik, the runtime used by previous versions of Android. ART is designed to improve application performance and make it easier to bring apps to new Android devices. ART is a just-in-time (JIT) compiler that compiles code at runtime, rather than at build time, which allows it to optimize code for the specific device it is running on. ART also provides ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, which compiles code at build time, so that apps can be installed and run more quickly.

### ART Features
- ART is a just-in-time (JIT) compiler that compiles code at runtime, rather than at build time, which allows it to optimize code for the specific device it is running on.
- ART also provides ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, which compiles code at build time, so that apps can be installed and run more quickly.
- ART is designed to improve application performance and make it easier to bring apps to new Android devices.
- ART is a new runtime for Android that replaces Dalvik, the runtime used by previous versions of Android.
- improved garbage collection.
- Support for debbuging  features.
- Support for 64-bit architectures.

### Dalvik
- Dalvik is a virtual machine that runs on Android devices. Dalvik is a register-based virtual machine that executes Dalvik bytecode, which is a modified version of the Java bytecode. Dalvik bytecode is compiled from Java source code by the dx tool, which is part of the Android SDK. Dalvik bytecode is optimized for the ARM and x86 instruction sets, which are used by most Android devices. Dalvik bytecode is also optimized for the MIPS instruction set, which is used by some Android devices.

## Android Studio
- Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development.
- It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems.
- Android Studio provides integrated Android developer tools for development and debugging.
- It also offers a unified environment where developers can build a UI and app module, test the app, debug it, and package it for deployment.

# Introduction to Gradle
- Gradle is a build automation tool that is used to build and test software projects. It is used to build Android applications. Gradle is written in Groovy and uses a Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL) to configure projects.

## Fundamentals of Gradle
### Basic Building Blocks
#### Activities
- An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do. Almost all activities interact with the user, so the Activity class takes care of creating a window for you in which you can place your UI with setContentView(View).
- Each activity is given a window in which to draw its UI with setContentView(View). The window typically fills the screen, but may be smaller than the screen and float on top of other windows. The activity is responsible for drawing and handling the user's interactions with the window.

- The activity is responsible for drawing and handling the user's interactions with the window.

#### Services
- A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an application running in the background for all kinds of reasons. A service does not provide a user interface. For example, a service might play music in the background while the user is in a different application, or it might fetch data over the network without blocking user interaction with an activity. Another component can start a service and it will continue to run in the background even if the user switches to another application. Once started, a service can run in the background indefinitely, even if the user switches to another application.

- Once started, a service can run in the background indefinitely, even if the user switches to another application.

#### Broadcast Receivers
- A broadcast receiver is a component that enables the system to deliver events to the application outside of a regular user flow, allowing the application to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. These events are called broadcasts. For example, the system notifies applications that the device is running low on memory by broadcasting an Intent with action ACTION_DEVICE_STORAGE_LOW. An application can use a broadcast receiver to get a notification that the device is running low on memory, and respond by cleaning up temporary files.

#### Content Providers
- A content provider manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access. Content providers are the standard interface that connects data in one process with code running in another process. Through the content provider, processes can share data with each other, even across applications. For example, the contacts provider manages the user's contact data. The contacts provider allows other applications to query the user's contact data. The contacts provider also allows other applications to modify the user's contact data. The contacts provider runs in the system process and has its own permission policy. Other applications can only access the contacts provider through a content provider interface that enforces the provider's permission policy.

### UI Components
#### Views
- A View is the basic building block for user interface components. A View occupies a rectangular area on the screen and is responsible for drawing and event handling. View is the base class for widgets, which are used to create interactive UI components (buttons, text fields, etc.). The ViewGroup subclass is the base class for layouts, which are invisible containers that hold other Views (or other ViewGroups) and define their layout properties.

#### Notifications
- A notification is a message you can display to the user outside of your application's normal UI. For example, you can use a notification to inform the user that background data synchronization is occurring, or to alert them that they have received a new email message. You can also use notifications to inform the user of events that happen while they are using your application, such as a phone call or a new instant message.

### Components for Communication
#### Intents
- An intent is an abstract description of an operation to be performed. It can be used with startActivity to launch an Activity, broadcastIntent to send it to any interested BroadcastReceiver components, and startService(Intent) or bindService(Intent, ServiceConnection, int) to communicate with a background Service. The most important use of intents is to start activities, which is the most common way that applications interact with each other.

#### Intent FIlters
- An intent filter is a description of an intent that the component would like to receive. You can declare intent filters for your activities, services, and broadcast receivers in your manifest file. When another component sends an intent, the system delivers the intent to all interested components. The system compares the intent that the sender has sent with the intent filters that each receiver has declared in its manifest file. If the intents match, the system delivers the intent to the receiver.

#### Android API Levels
- The Android platform is composed of a core set of APIs that are available to all apps, regardless of the target API level. In addition, there are APIs that are only available to apps that target a specific API level. For example, an app that targets API level 15 can use the new APIs introduced in API level 15, but it can also use all of the APIs that were available in API levels 1 through 14. However, an app that targets API level 14 cannot use any APIs that were introduced in API level 15.

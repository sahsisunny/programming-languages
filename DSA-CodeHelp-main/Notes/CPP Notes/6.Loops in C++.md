# Loops in C++
## Types of Loops
1. for
2. while
3. do-while
4. Nested loops for loops
5. Nested loops while loops
6. Nested loops do-while loops

## for
The for loop is used to execute a block of code multiple times. The syntax of for loop is as follows:
```c++
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

## while
The while loop is used to execute a block of code multiple times. The syntax of while loop is as follows:
```c++
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

## do-while
The do-while loop is used to execute a block of code multiple times. The syntax of do-while loop is as follows:
```c++
do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

## Nested loops for loops
The nested for loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. The syntax of nested for loops is as follows:
```c++
for (initialization1; condition1; update1) {
    // code to be executed
    for (initialization2; condition2; update2) {
        // code to be executed
    }
}
```

## Nested loops while loops
The nested while loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. The syntax of nested while loops is as follows:
```c++
while (condition1) {
    // code to be executed
    while (condition2) {
        // code to be executed
    }
}
```

## Nested loops do-while loops
The nested do-while loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. The syntax of nested do-while loops is as follows:
```c++
do {
    // code to be executed
    do {
        // code to be executed
    } while (condition2);
} while (condition1);
```

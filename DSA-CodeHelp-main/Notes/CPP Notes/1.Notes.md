## What is Flowchart?
Flowchart is a diagram that shows the steps in a process. Each step in the process is shown by a different symbol and these symbols are connected by lines and arrows. The sequence of the steps is shown by the order in which the symbols are connected by lines and arrows. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields.

## What is a Flowchart Symbol?
A flowchart symbol is a figure that represents a step in a process. Flowchart symbols are connected by lines and arrows to show the sequence of the steps in a process. There are many different flowchart symbols that can be used in a flowchart. The most common flowchart symbols are described below.

## Flowchart Symbols
- **Start/Stop:** The start symbol represents the beginning of the process. The end symbol represents the end of the process.
- **Process:** A process is a step in the process that requires some action. A process symbol is usually a rectangle with a short description of the process in it.
- **Decision:** A decision symbol is used to represent a decision in the process. A decision symbol is usually a diamond with a short description of the decision in it.
- **Input/Output:** An input symbol is used to represent an external source of data or information. An output symbol is used to represent an external destination for data or information.
- **arrow:** An arrow is used to show the sequence of the steps in a process. An arrow can be used to show the direction of the process, the direction of the data flow, or the direction of the information flow.
- **Connector:** A connector symbol is used to connect two or more symbols. A connector symbol is usually a line with an arrow at one end.

## What is Pseudocode?
Pseudocode is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do, expressed in a formally-styled natural language rather than in a programming language. Pseudocode often uses structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading.

## Example of Pseudocode
### Example 1
```c++
if (number is even)
    print "even"
else
    print "odd"
```

## What is Programming language?
A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programming languages that are designed to run on the web, while others are designed to run on a computer. Programming languages are used to create software and web applications.

### These are the most popular programming languages:
C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Swift, Go, R, Scala, Kotlin, Rust, Dart, Groovy, Haskell, Lisp, Lua, Objective-C, Pascal, Prolog, TypeScript, Visual Basic, Assembly language, COBOL, Fortran, HTML, CSS, SQL, Bash, MATLAB, R, and many more.

### What is a Programming Language Syntax?
A programming language syntax is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment in that programming language. The syntax of a programming language is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment in that programming language. The syntax of a programming language is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment in that programming language.

### What is C++?
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.

### What is C++ Variables?
A variable is a location in memory that stores a value. A variable is a location in memory that stores a value. A variable is a location in memory that stores a value.

### First Program in c++
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout << "Hello World"<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explain the code
- ```#include <iostream>``` is a preprocessor directive, which tells the compiler to include iostream file while compiling the code.
- iosream is a header file which contains the basic input/output stream objects like cin, cout, cerr etc.
- ```using namespace std;``` is a using directive, which tells the compiler to use the standard namespace.
- ```;``` is a statement terminator, which tells the compiler that the statement is complete.
- ```int main()``` is the main function where the execution of the program begins.
- ```{}``` are used to define a block of code.
- ```cout``` is an object of ostream class, which is present in the std namespace. It is used to display output on the console.
- ```<<``` is the insertion operator which is used to insert the right operand to the output stream.
- ```"Hello World"``` is the string literal which is to be displayed on the console.
- ```""``` are used to define a string literal.
- ```endl``` is an manipulator which is used to insert a new line.
- ```return 0;``` is the return statement. It terminates the main function and returns the value 0 to the calling process.


### What is C++ Data Types?
Data types are an important part of any programming language as it decides the type of data a variable can hold and the type of operations that can be performed on the data. C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. C++ supports various data types such as int, float, double, char, bool, void, wchar_t, and many more.

#### These are the most common C++ data types:
* int
* float
* double
* char
* bool
* void
* wchar_t

#### int
- The int data type is a signed integer type that is at least 16 bits wide. It is usually the fastest data type. It is used to store integer values.
- Size= 2 bytes
- Range= -32768 to 32767
- Example= ```int a=10;```

#### float
- The float data type is a single-precision floating-point type that is at least 6 decimal digits precision. It is used to store floating point values.
- Size= 4 bytes
- Range= 3.4e-38 to 3.4e+38
- Example= ```float a=10.5;```

#### double
- The double data type is a double-precision floating-point type that is at least 10 decimal digits precision. It is used to store floating point values.
- Size= 8 bytes
- Range= 1.7e-308 to 1.7e+308
- Example= ```double a=10.5;```

#### char
- The char data type is a single 8-bit unsigned integer. It is used to store a character.
- Size= 1 byte
- Range= 0 to 255
- Example= ```char a='a';```

#### bool
- The bool data type is a boolean data type that can store only true or false values.
- Size= 1 byte
- Range= true or false
- Example= ```bool a=true;```

#### void
- The void data type is a special data type that indicates that no value is available. It is used to define functions that do not return a value.
- Size= 0 bytes
- Range= null
- Example= ```void fun(){};```

#### wchar_t
- The wchar_t data type is a wide character data type that is at least 16 bits wide. It is used to store wide characters.
- Size= 2 bytes
- Range= 0 to 65535
- Example= ```wchar_t a=L'c';```




## Built-in Functions in C++
- ```sizeof()``` function is used to find the size of a variable or data type.
- ```getchar()``` function is used to read a single character from the console.
- ```getch()``` function is used to read a single character from the console without displaying it on the console.
- ```gets()``` function is used to read a string from the console.

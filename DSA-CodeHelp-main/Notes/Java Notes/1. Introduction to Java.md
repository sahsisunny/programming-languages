# Introduction to Java

## What is Java?
Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is a high-level programming language. This means that Java enables you to write programs that run faster and more efficiently than programs written in low-level languages such as C and C++.

## Why Java?
Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

## Java Versions
Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Java. This reference will take you through simple and practical approaches while learning Java Programming language.

## Java History
Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).

## Java Editions
Java has been developed by Sun Microsystems since 1995. Sun released several versions of Java SE (Standard Edition) and Java EE (Enterprise Edition). The latest versions of Java SE and Java EE are Java SE 8 and Java EE 7 respectively. Java ME (Micro Edition) is a lightweight version of Java for mobile devices. Java ME is not covered in this tutorial.

- **Java SE:** Java SE (Standard Edition) is a platform-independent implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition. It is the most widely used Java implementation. Java SE is used to develop desktop and server-side applications. Java SE is the basis for developing applications for the Java platform. Java SE provides a complete set of core classes that form the foundation of the Java platform. These core classes are supplemented by additional classes and packages that provide support for networking, security, database connectivity, distributed computing, and other advanced features.

- **Java EE:** Java EE (Enterprise Edition) is a platform-independent implementation of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition. It is used to develop enterprise applications. Java EE is the basis for developing applications for the Java platform. Java EE provides a complete set of core classes that form the foundation of the Java platform. These core classes are supplemented by additional classes and packages that provide support for networking, security, database connectivity, distributed computing, and other advanced features.

- **Java ME:** Java ME (Micro Edition) is a lightweight version of Java for mobile devices. 


## Java Development Kit (JDK)
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is an implementation of either one of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, Java Platform, Enterprise Edition, or Java Platform, Micro Edition platforms released by Oracle Corporation in the form of a binary product aimed at Java developers on Solaris, Linux, macOS or Windows. The JDK includes a private JVM (Java Virtual Machine) implementation, which is used to run Java programs. The JDK also includes tools useful for developing and testing programs written in the Java programming language and running on the Java platform. The JDK is a superset of the JRE, but while the JRE is used to run Java programs, the JDK is used to develop them.

## Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a set of software tools that allows a computer to run a Java program. The JRE consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java platform core classes, and supporting Java platform libraries. The JRE is the runtime portion of the software, which is all the software needed to run it in your Web browser. The JRE is not a development environment and does not contain development tools such as compilers or debuggers. If you

## Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode. The JVM is a crucial component of the Java platform. The JVM is a specification that describes the virtual machine, the bytecode instruction set, and the interpreter. The JVM is not a program, but rather a specification that must be implemented by a program. The JVM is a specification that describes the virtual machine, the bytecode instruction set, and the interpreter. The JVM is not a program, but rather a specification that must be implemented by a program.

## Syntax and Example of Java
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}
```

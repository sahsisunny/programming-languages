# Abstract class and Interface in Java
## 1. Abstract class
- An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract.
- It may or may not include abstract methods.
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.
- If a class includes abstract methods, then the class itself must be declared abstract.
- When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class. However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.
- Abstract classes are used to provide a common definition of a base class that multiple derived classes can share.

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}
```

## 2. Interface
- An interface is a completely abstract class that contains only abstract methods.
- An interface is not a class.
- An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world.
- An interface can be used to achieve abstraction.
- An interface is a collection of abstract methods.
- A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.
- Along with abstract methods, an interface may also contain constants, default methods, static methods, and nested types.
- Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods.
- Interfaces cannot be instantiatedâ€”they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.
- An interface is not extended by a class; it is implemented by a class.
- An interface can extend multiple interfaces.

```java
interface Drawable {
    void draw();
}
```

## 3. Difference between Abstract class and Interface
| Abstract class | Interface |
| --- | --- |
| Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods. | Interface has only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also. |
| Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance. | Interface supports multiple inheritance. |
| Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. | Interface has only static and final variables. |
| Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface. | Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class. |
| The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class. | The interface keyword is used to declare interface. |
| An abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces. | An interface can extend another Java interface only. |
| An abstract class can be extended using keyword "extends". | An interface can be implemented using keyword "implements". |
| Example: `abstract class Shape { abstract void draw(); }` | Example: `interface Drawable { void draw(); }` |

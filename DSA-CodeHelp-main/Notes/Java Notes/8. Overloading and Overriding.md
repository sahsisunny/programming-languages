# Method Overloading and Overriding

## Method Overloading
- Method overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their argument lists are different.
- It is similar to constructor overloading.
- It is also known as compile-time polymorphism.
- Example
```java
    class Adder {
        static int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }
        static int add(int a, int b, int c) {
            return a + b + c;
        }
    }
    class TestOverloading {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            System.out.println(Adder.add(11, 11));
            System.out.println(Adder.add(11, 11, 11));
        }
    }
```

## Method Overriding
- Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes.
- The implementation in the subclass overrides (replaces) the implementation in the superclass by providing a method that has the same signature as the one in the superclass.
- It is also known as runtime polymorphism.

- Example
```java
    class Animal {
        void eat() {
            System.out.println("eating...");
        }
    }
    class Dog extends Animal {
        void eat() {
            System.out.println("eating bread...");
        }
    }
    class TestDog {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            Animal a = new Animal();
            Animal b = new Dog();
            a.eat();
            b.eat();
        }
    }
```

# Multithreading in Java

## 1. What is Multithreading?
- Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU.
- Each part of such program is called a thread.
- Therefore, we can also say that multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more **threads** for maximum utilization of CPU.
- Each thread defines a separate path of execution.
- Multithreading is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
- Each thread defines a separate path of execution.
- Multithreading is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.

## 2. Why use Multithreading?
- Multithreading is used to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
- It can perform many operations at the same time, so it saves time.
- It can perform many operations at the same time, so it saves time.

### Example of Multithreading in Java
```java
class MultithreadingDemo extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        try {
            System.out.println("Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getId() + " is running");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Exception is caught");
        }
    }
}

class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 8;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            MultithreadingDemo object = new MultithreadingDemo();
            object.start();
        }
    }
}
```

##  Types of Multithreading
- There are two types of multithreading:
    1. User-level Thread
    2. Kernel-level Thread

### 1. User-level Thread
- User-level thread is also known as **lightweight thread**.
- It is managed by the **Java Virtual Machine**.
- It is implemented using the **Java Thread API**.
- It is also known as **green thread**.

### 2. Kernel-level Thread
- Kernel-level thread is also known as **heavyweight thread**.
- It is managed by the **operating system**.
- It is implemented using the **operating system API**.
- It is also known as **native thread**.

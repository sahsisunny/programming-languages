# Typecasting in Java

## Types of Typecasting in Java
1. Implicit Typecasting
2. Explicit Typecasting

## Implicit Typecasting
Implicit typecasting is done automatically when there is no possibility of data loss. For example, converting a smaller type to a larger type size. For example, converting an int to a long.

```java
long a = 100;
```

## Explicit Typecasting
Explicit typecasting is done manually by placing the type in parentheses before the value. For example, converting a larger type to a smaller size type. For example, converting a long to an int.

```java
int a = (int) 100L;
```

# Exception Handling in Java

## Types of Exceptions in Java
1. User Defined Exceptions
2. Built-in Exceptions

## 1. User Defined Exceptions
User defined exceptions are created by the programmer. They are created by extending the Exception class.

```java
class MyException extends Exception {
    public MyException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

## 2. Built-in Exceptions
Built-in exceptions are predefined exceptions that are provided by the Java API. They are divided into two categories:
1. Checked Exceptions
2. Unchecked Exceptions

### 1. Checked Exceptions
Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time. If some code within a method throws a checked exception, then the method must either handle the exception or it must specify the exception using the `throws` keyword.

```java
class MyException extends Exception {
    public MyException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            throw new MyException("This is my error message");
        } catch (MyException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Unchecked Exceptions
Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are checked at runtime. Unchecked exceptions are also known as Runtime Exceptions.

```java
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 0;
        int c = a / b;
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
```

## Keywords used in Exception Handling in Java
| Keyword | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `try` | It is used to specify a block where we should place risky code. The risky code is the code that may throw an exception. |
| `catch` | It is used to catch the exception. |
| `finally` | It is used to execute important code of the program. It is executed whether an exception is handled or not. |
| `throw` | It is used to throw an exception. |
| `throws` | It is used to declare exceptions. It doesn't throw an exception. It specifies that there may occur an exception in the method. It is always used with method signature. |
| `throwable` | It is the super class of all the exceptions in Java. |

4. Bitwise Operators
5. Assignment Operators
6. Unary Operators
7. Ternary Operators
8. Shift Operators

## 1. Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Addition | `a + b` |
| - | Subtraction | `a - b` |
| * | Multiplication | `a * b` |
| / | Division | `a / b` |
| % | Modulus | `a % b` |
| ++ | Increment | `a++` |
| -- | Decrement | `a--` |

## 2. Relational Operators
| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| == | Equal to | `a == b` |
| != | Not equal to | `a != b` |
| > | Greater than | `a > b` |
| < | Less than | `a < b` |
| >= | Greater than or equal to | `a >= b` |
| <= | Less than or equal to | `a <= b` |

## 3. Logical Operators
| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| && | Logical AND | `a && b` |
| \|\| | Logical OR | `a \|\| b` |
| ! | Logical NOT | `!a` |

## 4. Bitwise Operators
| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| & | Bitwise AND | `a & b` |
| \| | Bitwise OR | `a \| b` |
| ^ | Bitwise XOR | `a ^ b` |
| ~ | Bitwise Complement | `~a` |
| << | Left Shift | `a << b` |
| >> | Right Shift | `a >> b` |
| >>> | Zero Fill Right Shift | `a >>> b` |

## 5. Assignment Operators
| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| = | Simple Assignment | `a = b` |
| += | Add and Assignment | `a += b` |
| -= | Subtract and Assignment | `a -= b` |
| *= | Multiply and Assignment | `a *= b` |
| /= | Divide and Assignment | `a /= b` |
| %= | Modulus and Assignment | `a %= b` |
| &= | Bitwise AND and Assignment | `a &= b` |
| \|= | Bitwise OR and Assignment | `a \|= b` |
| ^= | Bitwise XOR and Assignment | `a ^= b` |
| <<= | Left Shift and Assignment | `a <<= b` |
| >>= | Right Shift and Assignment | `a >>= b` |
| >>>= | Zero Fill Right Shift and Assignment | `a >>>= b` |

## 6. Unary Operators
| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Unary plus | `+a` |
| - | Unary minus | `-a` |
| ++ | Pre-increment | `++a` |
| -- | Pre-decrement | `--a` |
| ++ | Post-increment | `a++` |
| -- | Post-decrement | `a--` |

## 7. Ternary Operators
| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ?: | Ternary Operator | `a ? b : c` |

## 8. Shift Operators
| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| << | Left Shift | `a << b` |
| >> | Right Shift | `a >> b` |
| >>> | Zero Fill Right Shift | `a >>> b` |

## Precedence of Operators
| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| () | Parentheses | `a + (b * c)` |
| ++ | Increment | `a++` |
| -- | Decrement | `a--` |
| + | Unary plus | `+a` |
| - | Unary minus | `-a` |
| ! | Logical NOT | `!a` |
| ~ | Bitwise Complement | `~a` |
| * | Multiplication | `a * b` |
| / | Division | `a / b` |
| % | Modulus | `a % b` |
| + | Addition | `a + b` |
| - | Subtraction | `a - b` |

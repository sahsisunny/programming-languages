# Arithmetic Operators
x = int(input("Enter the 1st number: "))
y = int(input("Enter the 2nd number: "))
# 1. Addition: adds two operands
print("Addition =", x + y)
# 2. Subtraction: subtracts two operands
print("Subtraction =", x - y)
# 3. Multiplication: multiplies two operands
print("Multiplication =", x * y)
# 4. Division (float): divides the first operand by the second
print("Division(Float) =", x / y)
# 5. Division (floar): divides the first operand by the second
print("Division(Floor) =", x // y)
# 6. Modulus: returns the remainder when first operand is divided by the second
print("Modulus =", x % y)
# 7. Exponent/Power : Returns first raised to power second
print("Exponent/Power =", x ** y)
